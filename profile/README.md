Welcome to the homepage of iVC, Intelligent Visual Data Coding Laboratory. Our laboratory is affiliated with the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Hefei, China. Our laboratory is devoted to the research and development of visual data coding theory, methods, techniques, standards, and applications.

Visual data include all the data that are or can be made visible to human eyes. We are interested in various kinds of visual data, including natural images and videos, biomedical images and videos, remote-sensing and aerospace images, point clouds, and the others.

We are especially interested in leveraging artificial intelligence, including but not limited to machine learning and deep learning technologies, for visual data coding. We are equally interested in crafting visual data coding technologies for artificial intelligence. In short, our laboratory focuses on intelligence for coding as well as coding for intelligence. We have the belief that our laboratory will continue to contribute in these fields of study.

Welcome to join us in the voyage of intelligent visual data coding!
